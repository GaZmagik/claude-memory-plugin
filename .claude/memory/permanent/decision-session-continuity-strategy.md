# Decision: Session Continuity Strategy

Implement multi-phase preservation and restoration:
1. Pre-Compact Hooks for automated preservation
2. Session Restore for context rebuilding
3. Session Continue for task resumption

Forked sessions prevent context bloat. Memory linking maintains graph cohesion.
