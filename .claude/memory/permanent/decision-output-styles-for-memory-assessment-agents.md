# Output styles for memory assessment agents

v1.1.0 will focus on three features: (1) Enhanced hint visibility via stderr hints, interactive prompts for complex thoughts, and better --help examples; (2) --auto flag using ollama for intelligent agent/style/model selection with transparency and graceful degradation; (3) Enhanced memory injection configurable via memory.local.md to inject gotchas/decisions/learnings based on relevance. Assessment profiles deferred to v1.2.0. Architecture follows 'separate concerns, combine via presets' pattern.
