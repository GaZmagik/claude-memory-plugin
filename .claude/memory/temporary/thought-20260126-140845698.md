## Thoughts

### 2026-01-26T14:11:42.614Z - Thought (model:unknown)
Provider routing tests should pin to an explicit decision matrix (capability + policy + priority/weight rules) rather than live provider health, or they’ll flake when quotas/latency shift. Verify failover semantics too: which error classes trigger reroute, how retry budgets and stickiness are applied, and that identical inputs yield the same chosen provider.
