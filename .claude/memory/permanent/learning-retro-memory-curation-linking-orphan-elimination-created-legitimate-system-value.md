Curator agent finding 24 orphaned memories + creating 20 semantic links improved graph health from 70→100/100. Not ceremonial; revealed that memory system was functional underneath index gaps. Three categories of benefit: (1) Discoverability—orphaned nodes now reachable, (2) Semantic coherence—v1.1.0 decision cluster now linked to gotcha/learning cluster, (3) Confidence—100% connectivity means no hidden knowledge silos. Future curation cycles should prioritize linking over deletion; the finding of 0 obsolete memories suggests retention-by-default is correct.
