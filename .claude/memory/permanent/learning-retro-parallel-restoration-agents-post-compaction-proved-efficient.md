Running memory-recall, memory-curator, and check-gotchas agents in parallel during session-restore with fresh context window worked well. Each agent had separate budget, tasks completed quickly without context conflicts, and results were valuable for maintaining continuity. Pattern worth repeating for future post-compaction restoration.
