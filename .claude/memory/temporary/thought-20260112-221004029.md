# Retrospective: Memory refactor session

_Thinking document created 2026-01-12T22:10:04.033Z_

## Thoughts

### 2026-01-12T22:10:04.103Z - Thought
Hook restart pattern: if hook doesn't fire, restart Claude before debugging. Memory protection hook worked perfectly once restarted.

### 2026-01-12T22:10:04.170Z - Thought
Atomic cleanup via sync command: memory sync handles orphaned index/graph entries automatically. Recommended over manual fixes.

### 2026-01-12T22:10:04.234Z - Thought
Dry-run validation: always run --dry-run before destructive operations. Caught embeddings cache bug before corruption.

### 2026-01-12T22:10:04.298Z - Thought
Gotcha: unquoted YAML titles with colons break parser silently. Validation at write time could prevent these.

### 2026-01-12T22:10:04.363Z - Conclusion
Process improvements: restart-then-verify hook pattern, use sync for cleanup, dry-run before operations. Validated 1365 skill tests pass with new code.
