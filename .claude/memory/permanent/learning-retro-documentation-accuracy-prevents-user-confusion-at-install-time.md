Fixed multiple README.md inaccuracies: local scope path (.claude/memory/local/ not .claude/memory/), removed outdated manual install instructions, clarified postinstall timing. Each fix prevented potential user confusion. Lesson: Documentation should match actual behavior exactly - users notice and trust degradation quickly.
