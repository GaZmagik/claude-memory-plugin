Using memory think with parallel Claude agent perspectives (--call claude --agent typescript-expert/performance-optimisation-expert/code-quality-expert) proved effective for decisions like 'how to handle embedding context limit'. Each agent brought distinct viewpoint: chunking complexity, streaming overhead, pragmatic truncation. Empirical data (actual file sizes) validated the pragmatic choice. Pattern: gather perspectives, then validate with data.
