Session completed 4 of 6 'Consider Fixing' review items (#10, #11, #12, #13) by deferring the expensive ones (#9: 313 errors, #8: 4h async work). Quick wins (#11: 0.25h, #12: 0.5h, #13: 1h) were batched efficiently. Key decision: pre-check on #9 (via 'tsc --flag') would have prevented 30m wasted on enable/test/revert. Lesson: front-load impact assessment for experimental flags.
