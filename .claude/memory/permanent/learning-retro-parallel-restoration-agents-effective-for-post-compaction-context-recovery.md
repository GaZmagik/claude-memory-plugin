Session restore spawned three agents in parallel (memory-recall, memory-curator, check-gotchas) with separate context budgets. Completed in single response with no blocking. Approach: approval key system ensures all three complete before continuing. Cost ~8% main session context. Pattern: parallelise stateless analysis work post-compaction.
