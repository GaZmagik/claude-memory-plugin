## Thoughts

### 2026-01-16T07:08:19.585Z - Thought (model:haiku [bbf9bda7-b581-4927-b8f9-e51eaf8bfb48])
The curator agent invocation via `--call` presents an interesting constraint—you're essentially asking whether the memory skill can orchestrate cross-agent consultation through a CLI parameter pattern. The architecture here requires the skill to spawn a subprocess that inherits the `--call claude` invocation context, which means the curator needs to be discoverable from the skill's execution environment, not just from the main Claude Code process.

The risk is that the skill's subprocess might not have the same agent registry loaded as the parent process. If the memory skill is running in a constrained environment—say, within a subshell or Docker container—the `--call` mechanism might fail silently or throw a "agent not found" error. You'd need to verify whether agent discovery happens at skill initialization time or dynamically at invocation.

The pragmatic approach would be testing this incrementally: first verify `--call claude` works from a simple bash script, then wrap that in a skill and observe whether the agent context propagates. If it fails, you might need to explicitly pass agent registry information through environment variables or configuration files that the skill can reference.

The alternative is that the memory skill doesn't need to invoke agents directly—instead, it could generate a formatted thought file that a user or orchestration layer reads and forwards to the appropriate agent. This trades real-time consultation for asynchronous deliberation, which might actually be cleaner given that thoughts are meant to be persistent anyway.
