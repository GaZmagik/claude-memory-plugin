## Thoughts

### 2026-01-14T20:09:14.615Z - Thought (model:haiku agent:memory-curator [a14d6ca9-2d96-4d6d-9c61-bf4e012165b3])
The current memory-curator agent architecture creates an interesting attribution challenge: it's fundamentally a **meta-agent about agents**, not itself an agent making implementation decisions.

When memory-curator runs in health-check mode, it's performing analysis tasks—identifying orphans, suggesting links, validating consistency—but these are *supporting roles* in service of human decision-making or other agents' work. It's more like a linter or validator than a decision-maker.

However, the agent does have moments of autonomous judgment:
- **Link suggestions**: It infers relationship types and confidence scores based on keyword analysis
- **Promotion candidates**: It ranks temporary memories by criteria and recommends which to promote
- **Health scoring**: It calculates numerical judgments about what constitutes "good" memory state

These aren't trivial—they involve heuristic reasoning and prioritisation. But they're all advisory. A human (or calling agent) still decides whether to act on them.

The real attribution problem emerges during **integration points**:
- When `/prepare-handover` calls memory-curator automatically, who owns the health assessment that blocks/unblocks handover?
- When a feature-implementation agent requests link suggestions, is the curator part of that agent's work or its own analysis?

The most honest attribution might be **context-dependent**: memory-curator is an agent when it's running standalone with autonomous analysis, but becomes a **tool** when invoked as a subroutine by other agents. The current instructions don't distinguish these modes clearly, which could lead to confused responsibility attribution in complex workflows.

Perhaps worth documenting: memory-curator should report its findings as structured data rather than decisions, preserving agency for whatever invoked it.
