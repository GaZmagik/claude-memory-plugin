Started with just async fs-utils (4h item #8), but kept adding work: .specify restructure, review report updates, then #9 (noUncheckedIndexedAccess with 313 errors). Session grew from 'finish fs-utils' to 'complete all remaining review items'. Better: commit to one scope, finish cleanly, then explicitly choose next work in fresh session.
