Post-compaction context restoration using 3 parallel agents (memory-recall, memory-curator, check-gotchas) completed in ~2 minutes with 100% success. Parallel execution was significantly faster than manual context recall. Pattern: session-restore → parallel agent launch → report → session-continue works smoothly.
