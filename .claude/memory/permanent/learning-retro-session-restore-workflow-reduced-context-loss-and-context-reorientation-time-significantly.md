The three-agent session restore (memory-recall, memory-curator, check-gotchas) ran in parallel and successfully restored enough context to continue work without re-reading code or re-establishing patterns. The gotcha reminder about coverage threshold clarity was particularly useful in narrowing subsequent work. Parallel agent invocation was efficient and allowed work to resume immediately without manual context reconstruction.
