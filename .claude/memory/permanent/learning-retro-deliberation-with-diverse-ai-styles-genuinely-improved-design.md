For v1.1.0 feature design, invoked memory think with --call claude --style [Architect, Devils-Advocate, Pragmatist, Security-Auditor]. Each perspective surfaced different concerns: Architect raised scope boundaries, Security-Auditor identified prompt injection risks, Pragmatist questioned feature necessity. This multi-perspective approach produced more robust design than solo deliberation. Pattern: use deliberately for complex decisions.
