After completing speckit workflow (explore → specify → plan → tasks → analyze → remediate) and reaching 84% context, commit all spec changes (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, research.md, checklist) to feature branch before starting fresh session for implementation. This preserves spec state and prevents context overrun during 103-task implementation.
