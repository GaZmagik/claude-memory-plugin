Completed TDD Red→Green cycle for US1 Enhanced Hint Visibility. All 130 unit and integration tests pass (94ms). Implemented 5 core modules: HintTracker (session state), HintOutput (stderr formatting), ComplexThought detection (>200 chars or ?), InteractivePrompt (prompts library), and integrated into think.ts. Pattern: write all tests first, mark checkboxes, implement modules, run full suite.
