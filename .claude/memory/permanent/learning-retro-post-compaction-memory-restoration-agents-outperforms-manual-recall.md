After session compaction, spawning three restoration agents (memory-recall, memory-curator, check-gotchas in parallel) faster and more complete than manual context reconstruction. Curator agent automatically calculated graph health improvement (79→94/100), identified orphaned nodes, and linked new memories. Result: Full context restored in <2min. Key: Agents have separate context budgets and parallel execution doesn't block main session.

Approach: Always spawn agents in parallel post-compact when restoring critical context. Skip if task is simple/atomic.
