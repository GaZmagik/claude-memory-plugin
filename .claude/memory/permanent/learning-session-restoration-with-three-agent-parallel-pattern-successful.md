Post-compact session restore used three parallel agents (memory-recall, memory-curator, check-gotchas) to restore context and audit memory system. Curator agent linked 10 orphaned nodes, bringing graph connectivity from 70% to 100%. Pattern: parallel restoration agents with specialized roles avoids sequential bottleneck and keeps context usage efficient.
