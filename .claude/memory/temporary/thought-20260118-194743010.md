# Claude Code Marketplace naming and plugin ideas

_Thinking document created 2026-01-18T19:47:43.017Z_

## Thoughts

### 2026-01-18T19:48:03.500Z - Thought
Marketplace name ideas - playing on Claude/AI themes: claude-extensions, claude-plugins, anthropic-extensions. Or more creative: claude-toolkit, claude-forge, claude-workshop, claude-depot, claude-bazaar

### 2026-01-18T19:48:14.731Z - Thought
Playing on the code/developer angle: code-plugins, dev-extensions, claude-dev-tools. Or abstract: claude-addons, claude-mods, claude-enhance

### 2026-01-18T19:48:34.285Z - Thought
Confirmed plugins: 1) claude-memory-plugin (knowledge persistence), 2) prompt-improver (refine user prompts), 3) session-continuity (restoration/continuation hooks). These form a 'cognitive enhancement' theme.

### 2026-01-18T19:48:39.184Z - Alternative
Additional plugin ideas: code-review-agent (multi-perspective reviews), test-generator (TDD assistance), doc-sync (keep docs aligned with code), git-workflow (smart commits/PRs), context-curator (manage what Claude sees), skill-builder (create custom skills easily)

### 2026-01-18T19:48:52.609Z - Counter-argument
Naming consideration: avoid 'claude' in the name if Anthropic might have trademark concerns. Neutral options: code-augments, dev-plugins, ai-toolkit, agent-extensions, cogni-tools

### 2026-01-18T19:48:57.093Z - Thought
More plugin ideas: security-scanner (OWASP checks), dependency-auditor (outdated/vulnerable deps), architecture-guardian (enforce patterns), migration-helper (framework/version upgrades), api-mocker (stub external services), perf-profiler (identify bottlenecks)

### 2026-01-18T19:54:04.443Z - Conclusion
Marketplace name decided: 'enhance' - simple, memorable, trademark-safe. Initial plugins: claude-memory-plugin, future TDD hooks extension with .tddignore support.
