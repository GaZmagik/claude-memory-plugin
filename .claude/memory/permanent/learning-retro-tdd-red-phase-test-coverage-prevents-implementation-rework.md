Writing comprehensive tests first (T041-T051) before implementation established correct module contracts. When Phase 3 implementation started (T052-T060), 52 unit tests passed on first try - zero integration bugs from mismatched interfaces. In future v1.1.0 phases, prioritise complete test suite before any implementation.
