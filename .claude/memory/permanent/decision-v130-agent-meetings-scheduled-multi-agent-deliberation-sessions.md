# v1.3.0 Agent Meetings - Scheduled multi-agent deliberation sessions

Agent Meetings concept validated architectural concerns but revealed bigger opportunity: autonomous agent orchestration. Consensus (10 agents): prove value with manual /meeting skill before building scheduling. Key insight: scheduling is easy; orchestration with memory persistence is the innovation. Decision: defer Agent Meetings to new 'Accord' plugin with broader scope - persistent working agents, meeting orchestration, dashboard UI, and local memory per agent. Agent Meetings becomes subset of Accord's capabilities.
