Session continued adding tests indefinitely once initial goals (bulk-unlink 75%→100%) completed. ai-invoke.ts remains at 39% but wasn't prioritized due to AI mocking complexity. Pattern: no clear stopping point communicated, leading to scope creep on coverage improvement. Future: define acceptable coverage floor and complexity thresholds upfront.
