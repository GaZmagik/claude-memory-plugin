Phase 0 estimated '0.5–1 day' but completed in ~10 minutes. Root cause: estimate conflated three distinct activities. Research validation (questioning technical decisions) was negligible once dependencies were identified. Verification (checking installed versions, reading existing code) was straightforward. Future estimates should break these down: (1) Research time: how long to validate unknown/uncertain decisions, (2) Verification time: how long to inspect existing code/systems, (3) Implementation time: actual coding. Phase 0 was ~40% research (already resolved in previous session), ~60% verification (quick). More accurate estimate would have been 20–30min.
