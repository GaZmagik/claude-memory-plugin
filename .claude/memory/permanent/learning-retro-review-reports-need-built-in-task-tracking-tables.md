The review report template used numbered lists for recommendations (Must Fix, Should Fix, Consider). After context reset, there was uncertainty about which items had actually been completed. Solution: Use checkbox tables with Status/Issue/Location/Effort/Resolution columns, plus a Resolution Progress section tracking [X/N] complete. This makes it trivial to verify progress during continuation.
